### 11.3 Agent Communication Examples

#### 11.3.1 Inter-Agent Message Passing
```python
from core.communication_manager import CommunicationManager, Message, MessageType

# Initialize communication manager
comm_manager = CommunicationManager()
comm_manager.start()

# Register agents
comm_manager.register_agent(
    agent_id="research_agent_001",
    name="Market Research Agent",
    capabilities=["web_scraping", "data_analysis", "competitor_research"]
)

# Send a research request
research_message = Message(
    type=MessageType.REQUEST,
    sender="orchestrator",
    recipient="research_agent_001",
    subject="Competitor Analysis Request",
    payload={
        "company_names": ["Competitor A", "Competitor B"],
        "research_depth": "comprehensive",
        "deadline": "2025-08-10T15:00:00Z"
    }
)

# Send message and wait for response
if comm_manager.send_message(research_message):
    print("Research request sent successfully")

# Get response (in actual implementation, this would be handled by the agent)
response = comm_manager.send_request(
    sender="orchestrator",
    recipient="research_agent_001",
    subject="Competitor Analysis Request",
    payload=research_message.payload,
    timeout=300  # 5 minutes
)

if response:
    print(f"Received response: {response.payload}")
```

### 11.4 Document Processing Examples

#### 11.4.1 RFP Document Analysis
```python
from core.document_processor import DocumentProcessor
from agents.analysis_agent import AnalysisAgent

# Initialize document processor
doc_processor = DocumentProcessor()

# Process RFP document
rfp_path = "/path/to/rfp_document.pdf"
processed_doc = doc_processor.process_document(rfp_path)

if processed_doc:
    print(f"Document processed: {processed_doc.title}")
    print(f"Pages: {processed_doc.page_count}")
    print(f"Word count: {processed_doc.word_count}")
    
    # Initialize analysis agent
    analysis_agent = AnalysisAgent()
    
    # Extract requirements
    requirements = analysis_agent.extract_requirements(processed_doc.content)
    print(f"Found {len(requirements)} requirements:")
    
    for req in requirements[:5]:  # Show first 5 requirements
        print(f"- {req['text']} (Priority: {req['priority']})")
```

### 11.5 Error Handling and Recovery Examples

#### 11.5.1 Robust Request Handling with Fallbacks
```python
from anti_scraping.request_handler import RequestHandler
from anti_scraping.user_agent_manager import UserAgentManager
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        try:
            response = self.request_handler.make_request(target_url)
            if response and response.status_code == 200:
                return {

                }
        except Exception as e:

            try:
                fallback_url = f"{fallback_prefix}{target_url}"
                response = self.request_handler.make_request(fallback_url)
                if response and response.status_code == 200:
                    return {
                        'success': True,
                        'content': response.text,

            except Exception as e:
                logger.warning(f"Fallback request failed for {fallback_url}: {e}")
        
        # All attempts failed
        return {
            'success': False,
            'error': 'All request attempts failed',
            'url': target_url
        }

# Usage
research_agent = RobustResearchAgent()
result = await research_agent.research_with_fallbacks("https://difficult-to-scrape-site.com")
print(f"Research result: {result}")
