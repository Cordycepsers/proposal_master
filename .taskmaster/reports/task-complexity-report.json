			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Core Technical Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of core technical infrastructure into granular subtasks covering project scaffolding, database provisioning, vector DB integration, async task queue setup, containerization, environment configuration, logging/monitoring, CI/CD, security hardening, documentation, and cross-component integration. Include subtasks for initial testing and validation of each component.",
			"reasoning": "This task encompasses foundational architecture across multiple domains (backend, databases, async processing, DevOps, security, and documentation). Each area involves industry-standard best practices (e.g., containerization, CI/CD, environment segregation, encryption), and the integration points are non-trivial. The breadth and depth of required setup, plus the need for robust testing and documentation, make this a highly complex, multi-disciplinary task."
