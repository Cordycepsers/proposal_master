# Client Module

## Overview

The Client Module provides specialized sub-agents for comprehensive client assessment and profiling within the Proposal Master system. This module evaluates organizational capabilities, compares client profiles against project requirements, and provides detailed compatibility analysis to support informed decision-making.

## Components

### 1. CapabilityEvaluator
**Purpose**: Evaluates organizational capabilities and readiness to execute projects based on technical, operational, and resource assessments.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-dimensional capability assessment (technical, operational, organizational, financial, strategic)
- Maturity level evaluation (1-5 scale with descriptive names)
- Capability gap identification and analysis
- Improvement plan generation
- Project fit assessment
- Readiness scoring with detailed recommendations

**Assessment Dimensions**:
- **Technical** (30% weight): Technology stack, architecture experience, development practices, security expertise
- **Operational** (25% weight): Project management, team size, experience level, delivery track record
- **Organizational** (20% weight): Change management, stakeholder engagement, resource allocation, decision making
- **Financial** (15% weight): Budget management, cost control, financial reporting, investment capacity
- **Strategic** (10% weight): Vision alignment, long-term planning, innovation capacity, market position

### 2. ProfileComparator
**Purpose**: Compares client profiles against project requirements and provides compatibility analysis with actionable recommendations.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-category comparison analysis
- Weighted scoring system with customizable weights
- Factor-level compatibility assessment
- Alignment strength and gap identification
- Risk assessment based on misalignments
- Detailed recommendations for improving compatibility

**Comparison Categories**:
- **Technical Alignment** (25% weight): Technology stack, complexity, security, scalability
- **Operational Alignment** (25% weight): Methodology, team structure, communication, delivery approach
- **Business Alignment** (20% weight): Industry experience, domain knowledge, market focus, strategic goals
- **Resource Alignment** (15% weight): Budget range, timeline expectations, team availability, infrastructure
- **Cultural Alignment** (15% weight): Work culture, communication preferences, decision-making style, risk tolerance

## Usage Examples

### CapabilityEvaluator Example

```python
from src.modules.client.capability_evaluator import CapabilityEvaluator

    'technical_complexity': 3.5,
    'management_complexity': 3.0
}

result = await evaluator.process({
    'client_profile': client_profile,
    'project_requirements': project_requirements,
    'assessment_scope': ['technical', 'operational']
})

# Result includes:

comparator = ProfileComparator()

client_profile = {
    'id': 'client_002',
    'technology_experience': {
        'languages': ['Python', 'JavaScript'],
        'frameworks': ['React', 'Django']
    },
    'budget_range': {'min': 50000, 'max': 150000},
    'industry_experience': ['finance', 'e-commerce'],
    'risk_tolerance': 'medium'
}

project_requirements = {
    'technologies': ['Python', 'React'],
    'estimated_budget': {'min': 80000, 'max': 120000},
    'industry': 'finance',
    'risk_level': 'medium'
}

result = await comparator.process({
    'client_profile': client_profile,
    'project_requirements': project_requirements
})

# Result includes:
# - category_comparisons: Detailed comparison by category
# - compatibility_score: Overall compatibility assessment
# - alignment_analysis: Strengths and gaps
# - recommendations: Specific improvement suggestions
# - risk_assessment: Potential compatibility risks
```

## Assessment Scoring

### CapabilityEvaluator Scoring

**Factor Scores (1.0-5.0 scale)**:
- 5.0: Excellent capability, exceeds requirements
- 4.0: Good capability, meets requirements well
- 3.0: Adequate capability, meets minimum requirements
- 2.0: Below average, some development needed
- 1.0: Poor capability, significant development required

**Readiness Levels**:
- **Very High** (4.5-5.0): Exceptionally well-prepared
- **High** (4.0-4.5): Well-prepared with minor gaps
- **Medium** (3.0-4.0): Adequate capabilities with some development needed
- **Low** (2.0-3.0): Needs significant capability development
- **Very Low** (0-2.0): Requires extensive preparation

### ProfileComparator Scoring

**Compatibility Scores (0.0-1.0 scale)**:
- 0.9-1.0: Excellent compatibility - Highly recommended
- 0.75-0.9: Good compatibility - Recommended with minor considerations
- 0.6-0.75: Fair compatibility - Possible with adjustments
- 0.4-0.6: Poor compatibility - Significant challenges expected
- 0.0-0.4: Very poor compatibility - Not recommended without major changes
