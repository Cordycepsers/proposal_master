**Schedule Risks - MEDIUM IMPACT**:
- 6-month timeline appears aggressive for full implementation
- Integration with existing systems may cause delays
- Testing and security certification could extend timeline

**Commercial Risks - LOW IMPACT**:
- Budget appears adequate for scope
- Standard payment terms reduce financial risk

**Competitive Risks - MEDIUM IMPACT**:
- Multiple qualified vendors likely to bid
- Incumbent may have advantage with existing relationships
